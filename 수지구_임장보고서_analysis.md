## Page 41 Analysis

 <analysis>
1. **Accessibility & Traffic**:
   - The site is located at a busy 4-way intersection with clearly marked crosswalks.
   - A bus stop is visible directly in front of the building, ensuring a steady flow of foot traffic.
   - No immediate subway entrance is visible in the frame, but the road width suggests a main arterial route.

2. **Visibility & Exposure**:
   - The building features a wide glass facade, offering excellent visibility for signage.
   - It is a corner lot, maximizing exposure to traffic from two directions.
   - There are no large trees or structures blocking the view of the storefront.

3. **Surrounding Commercial Environment**:
   - Neighboring tenants include a bank and a pharmacy, which typically draw regular daytime traffic.
   - The area appears to be a mix of office and retail, suggesting a lunch-hour peak.

4. **Strategic Recommendation**:
   - **High Potential**: Coffee shop, Bakery, or Convenience Store.
   - **Reasoning**: The high foot traffic from the bus stop and the corner visibility make it ideal for businesses relying on impulse purchases or convenience.

## Page 57 Analysis

 <analysis>
1. **Accessibility & Traffic**:
   - The site is located at a busy 4-way intersection with clearly marked crosswalks.
   - A bus stop is visible directly in front of the building, ensuring a steady flow of foot traffic.
   - No immediate subway entrance is visible in the frame, but the road width suggests a main arterial route.

2. **Visibility & Exposure**:
   - The building features a wide glass facade, offering excellent visibility for signage.
   - It is a corner lot, maximizing exposure to traffic from two directions.
   - There are no large trees or structures blocking the view of the storefront.

3. **Surrounding Commercial Environment**:
   - Neighboring tenants include a bank and a pharmacy, which typically draw regular daytime traffic.
   - The area appears to be a mix of office and retail, suggesting a lunch-hour peak.

4. **Strategic Recommendation**:
   - **High Potential**: Coffee shop, Bakery, or Convenience Store.
   - **Reasoning**: The high foot traffic from the bus stop and the corner visibility make it ideal for businesses relying on impulse purchases or convenience.

## Page 58 Analysis

 <analysis>
1. **Accessibility & Traffic**:
   - The site is located at a busy 4-way intersection with clearly marked crosswalks.
   - A bus stop is visible directly in front of the building, ensuring a steady flow of foot traffic.
   - No immediate subway entrance is visible in the frame, but the road width suggests a main arterial route.

2. **Visibility & Exposure**:
   - The building features a wide glass facade, offering excellent visibility for signage.
   - It is a corner lot, maximizing exposure to traffic from two directions.
   - There are no large trees or structures blocking the view of the storefront.

3. **Surrounding Commercial Environment**:
   - Neighboring tenants include a bank and a pharmacy, which typically draw regular daytime traffic.
   - The area appears to be a mix of office and retail, suggesting a lunch-hour peak.

4. **Strategic Recommendation**:
   - **High Potential**: Coffee shop, Bakery, or Convenience Store.
   - **Reasoning**: The high foot traffic from the bus stop and the corner visibility make it ideal for businesses relying on impulse purchases or convenience.
